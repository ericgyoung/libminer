The goal of libminer is to ...

## Installation

You can install the development version of libminer from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ericgyoung/libminer")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(libminer)
## basic example code
lib_summary()

lib_summary(sizes = TRUE)
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:
# libminer

Utility for Inspecting Libraries

https://posit-conf-2023.github.io/pkg-dev/setup.html

### package development
install.packages(
  c("devtools", "roxygen2", "testthat", "rmarkdown", "pkgdown", "purrr")
)

```{r}
# devtools::has_devel()

### show location of libraries on computer
# .libPaths()

```


Five forms, states:
- source: directory of files you interact with when building
- bundle: output of devtools::build()
- binary: output of devtools::build(binary = TRUE)
- installed
- in memory


# load devtools
```{r}
### includes loading usethis::
# library(devtools)
# packageVersion("devtools")

```

# create package directory

- final part of path will be package name
- sets up basic package skeleton
- opens a new RStudio project
- activates "build" pane in RStudio

```{r}

# create_package("C:/Users/user/libminer")

```

notes:

# licenses

MIT license very basic and simple
Apache license provides extra patent protection on top of MIT
CC0: dedicated to public domain
CC-BY: free to share and adapt but must give credit

copyleft: 
  
  - the code that someone else uses and builds on it has to be licensed as well

# Dependencies

Add package to DESCRIPTION file in Imports
call fxn like package::fun()

major benefit is the code makes it easy to remember where all functions come from, and reduces name conflicts
